# cms

I try to make cms for zenblog, there's still far from finish, what is done is basic functionality like add writer's bio, add category, add post.

The hardest part i think is to move wordpress data (besides, i try to look wp sql dump or wp data samples and i can't find it)

Also the styling of this repo is pretty much rubbish

MySQL structure is in clocms.sql
